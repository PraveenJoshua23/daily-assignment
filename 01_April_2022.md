## Day 9 of Internship at SurfBoard:

In the first session, Rexillia continued with the basic HTML and CSS. We learned further about how to add external CSS and how to make an element responsive to a screen. An external CSS is having all our css properties in another .CSS file rather than inside our main html file. This allows to have better readability and easy reference than having cluttered inline CSS. Css properties are written the same way as an internal Css by using reference to tags, classes or IDs. External CSS is the most commonly used type of CSS in the real world practice where there may 1000s of CSS attributes. Since having 1000s of CSS attributes in an inline or internal Css may seem overwhelming it is better to use an external CSS link. An external CSS is linked to the main html file using the `<link>` tag.  Here's a snippet of how it looks:
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">```
We can also make elements to behave responsively to other screen sizes by using CSS value measurements such as vw, vh, rem, em or %. A % is the best used measurement since it takes percentage calculation automatically based on the screen size. An example is as follows:
```.para {
width: 100%;
}```

In the afternoon, Hari Dev took a presentation on "Internet Protocols (IP)" and types of Internet Protocols. I learned about the different types of protocols such as:
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP), 
- Transfer Control Protocol (TCP),
- Telnet, 
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP),
- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP and HTTPS)
- Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).
 Each of the Protocol is required and important for the working of different parts of the internet like file sharing, sending and receiving mails, viewing websites, having security while browsing etc. So each of them work in interdependence with one another.

In the second session, Askin took a session on Obsession. We know that obsession means something that a person likes too much and always does to the point of being called crazy. But obsession can also be viewed as taking something with great interest and utilizing all the time and resources to accomplish a set goal. So having an obsession or being obsessed with something is not a bad thing. But requires a good control of emotions, keeping in check with reality and not losing your mind in the process. An obsession that lets you take control of the situation and put your will to accomplish your task, that's a good obsession. This is what I understood from the session and will continue to take it into practice if I can control my situation and emotions.

After the session by Askin, Anoop also took a small session on how to make a presentation and deliver it to an audience. It was really informative and useful to me since I always struggled to understand how to deliver any presentation to an audience. Firstly, it is important to structure your presentation with good flow from one slide to another, so having a table of contents is a good start. Also having too many slides may take you much time to cover many things so it's important to deliver the topic that you choose in bite-sized information to the audience after carefully researching everything there is about the topic. While delivering the presentation there need be a zone within which you need to stay while delivering the presentation, that is between audience interaction and Topic information. There should be a good balance between the two and not go too much beyond the scope of the topic which leads to offtopic content and confuses your audience.

Regarding my app idea, I have started working on the overall flow and wireframe of the app idea "Find a new owner" (New name coming soon!). So far I have come up with a Welcome/ Sign-in and sign up screen, user flow through the sign in process , user flow through the sign-up process and other pages such as home page, product details and description page, sending a request to the donor. Hopefully I can finish a working prototype in figma by tomorrow. And finish working demo by Friday (fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž).
