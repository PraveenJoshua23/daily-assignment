```

### Problem 2 Solution

```
numberToCheck = [1001001001001, 12345567891, 559922932941]
[100100100100, 1234556789, 5599229329] //Remove last digit
[200200200200, 2469113578, 11198458658] //Muliply from last digit by 2
213867772436 //Take the products and add them together
Error:) (I can't understand step 7)

### Problem 3 Solution:

```
max=0
input=(1,2,3)
input=1
if (input>max) then max=1
input=2
if (input>max) then max=2
input=3
if (input>max) then max=3
max=3
```


### Algorithm for solving the Towers of Hanoi

```
Step 1: Initialize there are 3 towers and 4 disks: Disk 1, Disk 2, Disk 3, Disk 4
Step 2: Disk 1 from tower 1 is moved to Tower 2
Step 3: Disk 2 from tower 1 is moved to Tower 3
Step 4: Disk 1 from tower 2 is moved to Tower 3
Step 5: Disk 3 from tower 3 is moved to Tower 2
Step 6: Disk 1 from tower 3 is moved to Tower 1
Step 7: Disk 2 from tower 3 is moved to Tower 2
Step 8: Disk 1 from tower 1 is moved to Tower 2
Step 9: Disk 4 from tower 1 is moved to Tower 3
Step 10: Disk 1 from tower 2 is moved to Tower 3
Step 11: Disk 2 from tower 2 is moved to Tower 1
Step 12: Disk 1 from tower 3 is moved to Tower 1
Step 13: Disk 3 from tower 2 is moved to Tower 3
Step 14: Disk 1 from tower 1 is moved to Tower 2
Step 15: Disk 2 from tower 1 is moved to Tower 3
Step 16: Disk 1 from tower 2 is moved to Tower 3
Step 17: Stop
```

### Problem 5 Solution

```
Step 1: Start by initializing some input of 4 digits.
Step 2: Take last digit and add it the number of time of the same digit
Step 3: If there is 2 digit result, take the 10s digit and add it the next digit from last digit of the input.
Step 4: Now repeat Step 2 until you reach the first digit of the input.
Step 5: Print result
```

### Problem 6 Solution

```
Step 1: Start by taking 2 non prime numbers, let them be a and b
Step 2: make calculation, a % b = R, where R is the remainder
Step 3: Let a = b and b = R
Step 4: Repeat Step 2 and 3 until a % b is > than 0
Step 5: GCD = b
Step 6: Stop
```

### Problem 7 Solution

```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize message = ;: :;;; ;:; ;: ;;;; ;: ::
Step 3: Find all : and replace it with _
Step 4: Find all ; and replace it with .
Step 5: Return the message
Step 6: Stop
```

## Problem 8 Solution

```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Get all 5000 certificates list
Step 3: Find the last item on the list
Step 4: Use a decrementing loop, create a list from the last item of this list and adding it to new list in ascending order.
Step 5: Print new list
Step 6: Stop
```

## Find the monster Algo - Task

```
We already have an end result that we want so we can refer to it and make a pattern to find the right monster.

Step 1: Initialize all monsters
Step 2: Keep a record of the monster we wish to find.
Step 3: Does Monster have a black hat?, if Yes, go to next step, if No, go to Step 0.
Step 4: Is Monster wearing a black coat? if Yes, go to next step, if No, go to Step 0.
Step 5: Does Monster have a white bow tie? if Yes, go to next step, if No, go to Step 0.
Step 6: Does Monster have a protruding tooth on the right side of his mouth? if Yes, go to next step. if No, go to Step 0.
Step 7: You have found the monster



Step 0: Not the Monster, move on to next monster.
