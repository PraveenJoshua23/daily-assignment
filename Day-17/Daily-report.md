## Day 17 of Internship at SurfBoard:

Today we had no sessions but we were split into two groups and allocated a group project for each of the teams. My team consists of Me, Ashein, Neelakandan, Zaheen and Hari dev. Our project goal is to build and develop a game which is similar to a spelling bee where a word is given and the user has to type the spelling of the word in the given field. There can be two levels of difficulty: Beginner and Advanced. Each having their own set of options that can either make the game easier or harder. So far we sat and discussed about how the flow of the game will be and made a flow chart diagram of all the components and pages that will be used for easier understanding as we jump into the designing and developing processes. 

I mostly used the whole day trying to learn more about Javascript loops and arrays for use in my project. I utilised freecodecamp.org inbuilt questions to solve problems related to arrays and loops. I learned how to link arrays, merge arrays, push elements from one array to another, delete items from an array. I also learned about Javascript Object Notation (JSON) and how they work. It is actually a collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realised as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array. An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realised as an array, vector, list, or sequence. Using JSON, we can store a lot of key value pairs of information which is easily readable in code too. I also learned about how we could incorporate using loops like while, if/else and for loops with arrays and objects to manipulate records within an object based on certain conditions. 

I also worked on a previous task of finding features that make an app experience really good from a product perspective. I have made a separate write-up on that topic and can be found in my repository. 

I have been reading more on the book of Extreme Ownership. It has been really motivating to read and know how the navy seals were operating in the war-torn times of Iraq and Afghanistan. I hope to start writing the book report by this week and also finish the book by this weekend if possible. 

Other than the sessions and internship training, I also understood things other than work or skills. I understood that it is important to take care of our body first. Everything else comes secondary. Since it is only possible to do the other things if our body is in the right shape and of a good mind. I felt really disconnected with what I wanted to do these past few days due to being sick and realised I need to take care of my eating habits, water intake and also exercise frequently. That was one of the major take-aways this last week.
