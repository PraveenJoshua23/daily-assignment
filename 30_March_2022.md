## Day 7 of Internship at SurfBoard:

In the first session today, Koushik continued about Propositional logics and we learned about  Logical Implications and Logical Biconditional. So Logical Implications is when a statement p implies the same to statement q. Logical implication is a type of relationship between two statements or sentences which verbally translates to "logically implies" in a if or then case statement.For example, if we have a sentence: __If you study well, you will get good marks.__
Where, ```p = you study well
q = you will get good marks```
We can understand how the statement logically implies from statement p to q with a truth table:
| p | q | p -> q |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| True | True | True |
| True | False | False |
| False | True | True |
| False | False | True |

Example: If you study well (T), and you do not get marks (F)=> False since you did not study well(p!->q, p does not imply q)
So generally when p implies q, it doesnt mean q also implies p (p -> q != q -> p ).
 
Then we have the Logically biconditional logic, where all p's implies to q's and all q's implies to p's. The best way of demonstrating a biconditional logic of the form P ↔ Q is to demonstrate that P → Q and Q → P separately. 
For example, we have a sentence: __ You will get good marks, if and only if you study well.__
where, ```p = You study well
q = You will get good marks.```

We can understand how the statement logically implies from statement p to q and q to p (P ↔ Q = P → Q and Q → P) with a truth table:
| p | q | p -> q |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| True | True | True |
| True | False | False |
| False | True | False |
| False | False | True |

The first and last support the logical biconditional. The first statement proves the biconditional. It says, "if you study well, you will get good marks". But the last statement does not disprove the biconditional because it doesn't say anything about the condition at all. 

In the second session of the day, Rexillia continued to teach us the basics of HTML and CSS. We saw about the `<div>` tag, how we can use a parent div and a child div to style the contents. So we also saw some style properties like `text-align`, `width`, `height` and `border`. The `text-align` property allows to align text as well as content in the div. The `width` and `height` properties change the width and height of the element. The `border` property gives a border to the element that it styles, so the propery should contain the following values : ` pixel border-type color` (Example: `border-radius: 2px solid white;`). We also saw about commenting withing the html file for adding notes to developers who might view the code. The syntax of a comment is like this : `<!-- Some Comment -->`.

This wraps the things I learned during the sessions. I was also tasked with thinking about app ideas through the day but I hope I have some by the end of the day.
