## Day 8 of Internship at SurfBoard:

In the first session for today, Rexillia taught us more on HTML and CSS. We saw another css property called `border-radius` which is used to made box elements have rounded edges. The depth of the rounded edges depend on the amount of pixel that has been specified. It also possible to make circular elements on the page using this property. All we need to do get a circular element is have the same width and height and setting the border-radius to half of what the height or width is. After that we saw how to use internal CSS with classes and ids. The internal CSS is used within the `<head>` tag, using the `<style>` tag attribute within it. Classes can be used with multiple tags whereas Ids can be used for unique styling a tag. 

In the second session, Askin took a session on Algorithms and why we need them. Algorithms are a crucial part in software development. We need to learn to **breakdown** problems into smaller pieces or steps to achieve the final solution. Algorithms work the same way, they help to tell the computer step by step functions that would eventually lead to the solution that we desire. So it is important to visualize and understand the solution that we are looking for before we think of executing it in the form of an algorithm. We were also given an individual task on writing a step-by-step algorithm on making biryani and also on making a stone brick. I will write a separate writeup on it and send it to you.

There was also a presentation given by my intern mates, Zaheen and Ashein. Zaheen did a presentation on a travel app prototype that he designed on Figma called ZeHive. The idea of the app is to find travel buddies who can join long roadtrips by bike or car. The app allows them to find them and get their personal information to find out how and when the travel journey goes on. 
Ashein did a presentation on the differences between UI and UX. UI stands for User Interface and UX stands for User Experience. Both are integral part of the development cycle in any app or website. Both of them may have independent designers or single designer carrying out both tasks. Main idea of UI designer is to give an app that looks good and comfortable to use. UX gives the ease of use to the experience. In simpler terms, UI can be like seeing a beautiful and well-iced cake, whereas UX is like getting a taste of the cake itself. UX involves brainstorming, researching user personas, interests, conducting surveys, and wireframing the app and also getting an idea of the user's flow through the app. This shows the difference in how UI works and UX works.

Today, I also finalized the app idea that I would be going with to design and develop a working prototype. I decided with the idea of "Find a new owner", and will use Figma and Flutter to bring it to life. This concludes the events of the day for this report.
