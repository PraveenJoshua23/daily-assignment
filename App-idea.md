## App Ideas and Potential Problems during Implementation

### App Idea 1:
1. **FoodAdvisor**: An app that shows hotspot restaurants within a 10km radius, Menu recommendations, food recommendations, local delicacies based on Geo-location.

**Problems that we can face:**
- Lots of groundwork needed to find the hidden gems of good food locations. 
- Maybe need large number of people  depending on the area of coverage for the app's target audience.
- Needs verification for user recommended hotspots


### App Idea 2:
2. **Find a new owner** - If you have watched Toy Story 4, you would have seen Andy donating toys to charity. Similarly this app lets you give your old suitcases, toys, or used furnitures, electronics etc to anyone in need as charity. The one who needs something would request the item with a short summary on why they need it and the seller can chose who to give it to.

**Problems that we can face:**
- Need a way to verify the donater, and the item they are giving away is legit and not a scam.
- Might need a disclaimer that we are not responsible for them receiving damaged products.
- Need 

### App Idea 3:
3. **ReFuel On-Demand** - if your vehicle is stuck without petrol or diesel and there are no petrol stations nearby, aan operator is sent to refuel the said vehicle. Also recharge electric vehicles that are stranded without any charge.

**Problems that we can face:**
- Running costs may be high for vehicles, and personal.
- Preparing vehicles equiped with right safety mechanisms for both petrol and electric.

### App Idea 4:
4. **Personal Learning guide**: Based on the inputs of interests that the user wants to learn, a roadmap with external links to resources on websites and youtube are shown for the user to follow and study.

**Problems that we can face:**
- Lot of research and resource gathering phase is necessary.
- Might Need a roadmap model with which we can deliver the contents to the user.

### App Idea 5:
5. **BucketList**: Bookmarking products on any store and Tracking them until they go down on sale and are alerted to the user as well as possible coupons available with the product.

**Problems that we can face:**
- Might need an automation to make it work and also maintaining it.
- Research needed to find coupons.
