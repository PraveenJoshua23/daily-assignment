# Product Management


### What is Product Management?

Product Management is an organization funcation which guides every step of a product's lifecycle , all the way from design and development to positioning and pricing, by focusing on the product and it's customers.


### What is a Product Manager?

Product managers are responsible for ensuring that a product meets the needs of its target market and contributes to the business strategy, while managing a product or products at all stages of the product lifecycle.

**Role of a Product manager:**

  - Understanding and representing user needs.

  - Monitoring the market and developing competitive analyses.

  - Defining a vision for a product.

  - Aligning stakeholders around the vision for the product. 

  - Prioritizing product features and capabilities.

  - Creating a shared brain across larger teams to empower independent decision-making.

While a product manager defines the direction of the product through research, vision-setting, alignment, and prioritization, the product owner should work more closely with the development team to execute against the goals that the product manager helps to define.

**Difference between Product Manager and Product Owner**

|  Product Manager  |	Product Owner  |
|--------------|--------------|
| Works with outside stakeholders | Works with internal stakeholders |
| Helps to define the product vision | Helps teams execute on a shared vision |
| Outlines what success looks like | Outlines the plan for achieving success |
| Owns vision, marketing, ROI | Owns team backlog and fulfillment work |
| Works at a conceptual level | Involded in day-to-day activities |


**7 Stages of Product Management Process**

The product management cycle may differ, depending on the project we're working on but in general, it can be broken down into the following steps: idea sourcing, idea screening, market & user research, strategy development, product creation, testing & feedback gathering, and product improvements. 

1. Idea sourcing
2. Idea screening
3. Market & User Research
4. Strategy development
5. Product creation
6. Testing & feedback gathering
7. Product Improvement

__Step 1: Idea Sourcing__

This stage when there is generation of an idea and thought process over how much time it would require to invest as well as research if it has been already implemented. As well as thinking about basic solutions to the same idea and juggling thoughts about what else would benefit it. Two main ways this happens is through research and brainstorming.

__Step 2: Idea Screening__

This stage defines the idea into specifications and checking if these are reachable and effective specs. The discussions happen with a group or teams. It also helps to filter out non effective tasks and unreasonable expectations and pick the ones that make the most sense for the idea. The main point of this stage of the product management cycle is to check the idea's feasibility. It should be something that can be built by the current team. 
Try to describe your idea in one clear sentence and answer the following questions:

   - What problem do I try to solve?
   - How do I understand it's successful?
   - How do I want people to talk about my idea?

__Step 3: Market & User Research__

This step goes into researching the market and user needs that align with our idea. It is also important to explore the existing market and figure out where our idea can help and solve something. Basically market research involves the following: 

- evaluating the size of the market
- exploring the competition
- finding out competitor's weaknesses
- looking for scope of improvement

The main focus of research at this phase should be on the user's needs and user's desires. So here we can, conducts interviews. surveys and focus groups and use that resulting research to understand how we can fill in the gaps.

__Step 4: Strategy Development__

At this stage, we have a product vision and so we need to have a strategy to shape it into reality. A strategy is created after careful planning all stages of the productions lifecycle. The best way to break the product strategy is with a product roadmap. A product roadmap includes:

- Business goals and objectives
- Product rates
- Features of a product
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Order of priorities

The whole team needs to be on the same page and use the product roadmap as a tool for the whole team.

__Step 5: Product Creation__


At the stage of product creation, the focus is on value. Firstly, perfection doesn't equal effectiveness, Secondly, minor failures are excusable if it's an idea that distrupts the industry. So to test the idea and the retention its gains with users, a simple app or landing page is used to test the value and check the reaction. This is the minimum viable product (MVP), once it serves its purpose we can move on the next iteration.

__Step 6: Testing & feedback gathering__

After the MVP is released, it's time to setup a feedback collection mechanism. Firstly, we need to check how a user interacts with our product, capture feedback, find possible improvements and then communicate the product requirements to the team, implement the changes, and test. This stage should go through this cycle during the entire product development process.

__Step 7: Constant Product Improvement__

Through this process, this stage would not be considered the last or the endpoint but focus now shifts towards optimization and efficiency.
