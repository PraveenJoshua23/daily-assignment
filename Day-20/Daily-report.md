## Day 20 of Internship at SurfBoard

Today we continued to work on our own group projects. I was still unable to break through some barriers to get the desired output that I wanted in my task. I am struggling a bit with Javascript on the logical part for the spelling bee app. I was unable to understand the working of arrays properly. So I was learning about how to manipulate arrays through the MDN docs and other Youtube videos. I learned about the `sort`, `reduce`, `split`, `replace` and `map` functions to manipulate arrays. I also learned about modern ES6 javascript methods like `Array.from` and `...spread` operators. I still have not grasped some of the concepts completely, but my understanding has improved than before. I am also doing some exercises posted on the MDN website to better understand these concepts. 

After lunch, we had a culture talk session along with all the employees here at SurfBoard. Abraham spoke about how we set "goals" based on "Wants" that are influenced by the reality that we have believe in. He used the example of a Chef and a Cook, comparing how both of them would have a different approach when they are told to cook something unique that doesnt exist. The same also applies with one who learnt to drive through a driving learning center vs someone who learned by taking the risk and learning by themselves.  They both have a level of comfort zones which maybe at a higher level for someone who has done more focused training on the topic. Beyond that level of comfort would be anything that causes stress. And stress increases over time and may reach a breaking point beyond which the person feels he cant go further. Just like in a gym when a person works out, he may reach a point where he cant bench press anymore but when a trainer pushes him harder, he could do 2 or 3 or more than he initially did. So there are points where we could push a little bit more beyond our stress breaking point which would also in turn lead to gaining some sort of stress tolerances over time based on how focused you are at that task. He also talked about distractions, where we could want to do something else when we are stressed like taking out the phone and scrolling through instagram. Even this action could lead to our brains to pile on more stress. Stress is basically  something that is being used or made to use effort and energy. Even a simple task like scrolling through instagram is using some energy when we move our attention from our task and go do something less stressful. So even we were to "distract" ourselves from a stressful task, we need to remove or delete all that from our mind and go do something else in order to relieve the built up stress. He talked about all of this based on the goals that we set. And the reality that we believe in influences those goals. When the reality that we live in and the reality that the goal is in does not have have correlation, those become just meaningless and impossible goals. So we need to understand the reality that we believe and live in, and ask the right questions of first whether our reality matches with the reality around us. Then we need to list down our goals and focus ourselve to be able to reach those goals given we have what it takes to reach them. We might think money also plays a huge role in setting these goals, but money is just a proxy.
