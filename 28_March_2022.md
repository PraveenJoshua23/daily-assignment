#Day 5 of internship at Surfboard:


In our first session today, we saw more problem solving related examples. Through one problem, "Crossing the River" problem, I realised that it's not always possible to have a solution to a problem unless some constraints have been tweaked or modified. This particular example had many outcomes with the given constraints but none can reach a conclusion. Although in real life scenarios there is always a solution as long as constraints and operations are carefully weighed. We also saw another problem, "Connect the points such that they don't touch more than once". This problem which looked like it doesn't have a solution at first but only after weighing in all outcomes do we come across a solution. So I realised not to give up on any problem and to see through all possible outcomes in iterations or permutations to reach a solution.

I was given the task of reading and researching about Operating Systems today. I thought I already knew all too well about operating systems but I learnt a few new things too. I learned about the types of operating systems: 
Batch Operating System
Time-Sharing Operating System
Distributed Operating System
Network Operating System
Real-Time Operating System
All Operating systems either have Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Some examples of commonly used Operating systems are:
Windows (GUI based)
GNU/ Linux (CLI/GUI based)
Mac OS (GUI based)
Android (Mobile GUI based)
iOS (Mobile GUI based)
What exactly is an Operating system? An operating system is a program on which application programs are executed and acts as a communication bridge (interface) between the user and the computer hardware. Its main tasks include allocation of resources and services like allocation of memory, devices, processors and information. 
The goal of an Operating System is to execute user programs and to make tasks easier. So it uses all hardware systems to perform these tasks like the brain of the body controlling all the limbs. A more detailed report on operating systems is underway.

In the second session of the day, we saw about git again and learned about using .md files (Markdown file) usually used in GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket for writing installation guides or basic documentation in the file repository. It is also used as a file descriptor. We can use basic formatting in the file using the following commands (I also added in a few which I learned online):
Heading formatting:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
Text Formatting:
*Some Text* => Some Text //Becomes Italics
**Some Text** => Some Text //Becomes Bold
***Some Text*** => Some Text //Becomes Bold and Italics
> Some Text => Makes text appear like a quote
~~Some Text~~ => this will appear with a strikethrough in text
List Formatting: 
1. ,2. , 3. like a traditional text editor
* for unordered list
Code Formatting:
Using ` before the code, for eg: `forEach(), will make the code formatted with a grey background.
Using ``` in a code block, this will format the code contents like a text editor with different colored texts.
Other Formatting: 
Horizontal Line/Divider: We can also format using a divider line either using *** or — in a single line space where *** is a thicker line and — is a thin line.
Tables: We can also have tables when formatted in the following way
|Name|Email|Address|      <= This is the heading of the table
|----|-----|-------|      <= This is the separator.
|John|john@example.com|Address1| <= This is the table body.

I also conversed with a few other employees I haven’t spoken to and will include the details in the detailed report later. This concludes the events of learning and realisations through the day.
