## Day 10 of Internship at SurfBoard:


Today we had only one session where Initially Askin went through the algorithm problems and the potential solutions for some of them that were given on Friday evening. I have added a separate file on the solutions of the algorithm problems. After that, Koushik took a session on Data and Data types.

### What is Data?

Data is anything that gives information which may be in the form of integer numerical values or text or other forms of representation of data.

**Types of Data or Data types**
We learned about the different types of data such as:
- Numbers or numeric values
- Text or strings
- Decimal or float
- Boolean values, which may be true or false
- Audio, type of data
- Video, type of data

**Operators**
We also learned about operators that are commonly used in any programming language. These are some of the basic operators:
- Arithmetic Operator
- Boolean Operator
- Logical Operator


**Arithmetic Operator:**

Arithmetic Operators are operators that perform mathematical calculations. They can be represented as follows:
- `+` performs addition
- `-` performs subtraction
- `*` performs multiplication
- `\` performs division
- `=` acts as assignment of value
- `++` is an Incremental operation
- `--` is an Decremental operations

**Boolean Operator**

Boolean operators perform operations that either return True or False as a result of the operating values. Some boolean operator operations are:
- `==` ,checks a condition if the value or data is "equal to" the other data type.(Eg: 2==3 //False)
- `<` ,checks a condition if the value is less than the other.(Eg: 5>3 //True)
- `>` ,checks a condition if the value is more than the other.(Eg: 4`<`5 //True)
- `<=` ,checks a condition if the value is less than or equal to the other. (Eg: 4<=4 //True)
- `>=` ,checks a condition if the value is more than or equal to the other. (Eg: 5>=4 //True)
- `!=` ,checks a condition if the value is not equal to the other. (Eg: 4!=5 //True)


**Logical Operator**

Logical operators perform operations that check if the conditions of an expression are logically AND, logically OR or logically NOT.
They are represented in computational terms as follows:
- Logical AND `&&`
- Logical OR `||`
- Logical NOT `!`


Other than the session today, I also learned about the Dart programming language in my own time. It is an Object Oriented Programming language like C++ or Java. It is used to develop web and mobile apps on iOS as well as Android. Since it is an object oriented language, it is entirely class-based and refers to everything as objects.
I also continued with my app idea project and almost completed the UI design phase with a little bit of prototyping done. Through the project as an exercise, I learnt more efficient ways of doing things in Figma using components. I also learned how to create smart animations in the prototyping mode using the smart animate feature.
I completed the installation of flutter on my system with the help of Ameen after I was stuck in the installation process. I understood how to do the installation process and how flutter is dependent on other softwares and packages in order for it to run. These dependencies are important for many cases in runtime compilation, environment and having packages from Android studio SDK accessible so as to make apps cross-platform enabled. Ameen also helped me get an idea over the mental model while approaching designing an app in flutter. We can visualise our screen (Scaffold in flutter terminology) as rectangles that are positioned in columns and rows. By identifying this, it becomes easier to make a layout according to our needs.
