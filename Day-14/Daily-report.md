## Day 14 of Internship at SurfBoard:


Today Koushik took a session on the basics of functions, methods and variables. A function is a block of organized code that is used to perform a single task. They provide better modularity for your application and reuse-ability. Depending on the programming language, a function may be called a subroutine, a procedure, a routine, a method, or a subprogram. Variables are the names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program. With variables we can do the following:

- Create variables with appropriate names
- Store your values in those two variables
- Retrieve and use the stored values from the variables

In object-oriented programming, a method is a programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class. A class can have more than one method. When a function is written inside a class it is called a method and when the same method is written outside the class then it is called a function.

Other than the session, I also tried to debug errors in my flutter app. Some main bugs I had was the overflow error and improper input text hover on typing. I was able to fix the overflow error with the help of some forums on stackoverflow( what an irony!). The solution was to add a vertical listViewScroll widget to the element that was causing the overflow to happen. That fixed the bug and made it responsive when the keyboard appears too. The other error was a bit tricky and I was not able to solve it for now but I will keep trying to fix it soon.

After the session with Koushik, I spoke to him regarding the use of frameworks and why we use it. We talked about the different frameworks in javascript like Vue.js, Angular and React. We also discussed about Algorithms and data structures. I realised that algorithms are basically just the breaking down of complex problems into simple solutions, for example: divide and conquer algorithm. This helped to break the block in my mind that algorithms are hard to understand but if we understand what kind of problem it is solving it is easier to understand the process in which it is to be implemented.

Rahul gave a presentation on his app idea regarding Waste Management. It was a really good initiative if implemented but has many factors such cost and management of human resources as well as disposal of the collected waste. We all had a good brainstorming session regarding how the app could be made into reality and how it could be sustained financially using tax cut strategies that Companies do for NGOs. It was a good presentation overall.
