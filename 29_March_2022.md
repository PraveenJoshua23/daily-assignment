## Day 6 of internship at SurfBoard:

======

Today during the first session, Koushik taught us about Propositional statements and proportional logics. To understand this he used a set a statements are had some or the other connection with the other that shared a common logic with one other. It is also known as sentential logic or statement logic. Usually a normal sentence is said to a declarative, interrogative, imperative or exclamative sentence. Each one of these can either tell us something, throw a question or command or shows expression. Propositional logic is the branch of logic that studies ways of joining or modifying propositions, statement or sentences to form much more complicated propositions, statements or sentences which have a logical relationship and properties from the altered statements.For example:
- There is an animal outside
- There are cats outside.
- There is a dog outside.

These set of statements although have a common view that there is some animal outside, is actually Logically not true on the whole unless one of the sentences can be altered or modified.
So propositional statements would have logics that are:
- Logically Not (~)
- Logically And (^)
- Logically Or (v)
When two statements are joining together "and" the statement formed is true, that is because both statements are true. When One of the statements are joined together but they are "not" true but false, thats because either one of them may be false. Same follows for the "or" statement. 

In the second session, Rexillia took a class on the basic HTML tags and how it is shown on the website. So we saw tags like `<html>`,`<head>` and `<body>` which are like the main tags in any HTML code. We also saw how we can give a title to our page with `<title>`  tag that displays a title description on the tab of the browswer as well as any other tags that is mentioned within the <head> tag. We also saw formatting our text with headings with 6 levels of heading using `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>` and `<h6>` which have descending levels of fonts heading sizes. Our paragraphs can be formatted with `<p>` tags. We can use the `<a>` tag to add links to our page, a short example is like this: 
```<a href="https:www.google.com" target="_blank">Click me!</a>```
where target allows the browser to open link in new tab.
We also saw other text formatting within HTML like `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italics and `<u>` for underline. Ofcourse the main thing with HTML tags is not to forget to close the tags otherwise it wont be working on the page. We also studied a little bit of CSS with inline CSS, using inline styles like for example:
```<p style="font-size= 14px; background-color='red';">```
CSS allows us to stylize our boring HTML code and beautifies it. We can customize it to our needs to achieve the design we need for the used to experience, therefore it is very important in the frontend part of the website. 
Other than the sessions, I also read through Operating Systems book in the bookshelf and learned about File Management systems and file structures in the operating system. I also experimented using Figma and got to know the tools used in it following a tutorial on Youtube. I am exploring more about the inner workings of FrontEnd and BackEnd Development.
